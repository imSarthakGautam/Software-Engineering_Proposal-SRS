# Software-Requirements-Specifications
A software requirements specification (SRS) is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software under development. The SRS fully describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform.

An SRS minimizes the time and effort required by developers to achieve desired goals and also minimizes the development cost. A good SRS defines how an application will interact with system hardware, other programs and human users in a wide variety of real-world situations. 

## Purpose of an SRS
An SRS forms the basis of an organizationâ€™s entire project. It sets out the framework that all the development teams will follow. It provides critical information to all the teams, including development, operations, quality assurance (QA) and maintenance, ensuring the teams are in agreement.
